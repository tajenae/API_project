Brief analysis on how this project ties in with Climate Change - obseravtions and insights.

This project gave me a hands on look at how weather data can reveal patterns tied to climate change, 
something which I feel very passionate about. So for this analysis, I have used the graphs as well as the data 
from the csv file and the additional info provided on each website which helped me to analysis the data I was working 
with and what that data meant. 

For NOAA data, I noticed fluctuations in temperatures, like a dip from November 21 to 23, 2024, which could indicate 
local weather events or seasonal shifts. I used this current observation to make sense of how the weather looked in the 
past and how it might look in  the future as well and what this might mean for the world. The daily variations from NOAA 
are aligned with what I observed when I also looked at the meteo data. 

 As meteo provided historic data with no limits compared to noaa, I observed that the maximum temperatures hovered around 
 the 55°F line in the 1950s but have risen to an average of around 58°F between the decades of 2000-2020, with a sharp dip 
 in 2016 dropping below around 54°F. Looking ahead, projections from 2020-2040 suggest many highs will probably exceed 60°F, 
 showing a clear warming trend. Minimum temperatures have followed a similar path, gradually increasing since 1950, with occasional 
 dips like those around 1980s and late 1990s. These rising temperatures both minimum and maximum fit into the broader narrative of 
 climate change driven by global warming. Seeing these patterns on the graphs helped me connect the data to real-world climate concerns. 

One hopeful takeaway from this project is that by looking at how temperatures have changed over time, we can better understand t
he impact of climate change and take action to address. And hopefully, by making positive changes like embracing renewable energy, 
reducing pollution and prioritizing earth’s resources, we can create a more sustainable planet for future generations and even for 
our future selves.
