Project: API-Driven Application with OOP and Visualizations

Climate Change Analysis through Weather Data

My project focuses on analyzing weather data over a specific period for a chosen region, and in this case I have focused on the New York region. The primary objective is to identify patterns and trends that could reflect climate changes and to explore how these insights might help in predicting future shifts in climate. To achieve this, I have integrated multiple APIs to gather relevant data the information and store them in separate files.

Project Overview

This project involves retrieving, processing, and visualizing critical weather data, such as temperatures, precipitation, and extreme weather events, recorded over time. The analysis includes cleaning the data, applying object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, and creating visual representations that highlight key findings.

Data Analysis: I will be generating average temperatures and analyze historical trends spanning several years or decades depending on how nuch historical data I am allowed to retrieve from the API. This will help in visualizing global temperature rises and identifying outliers indicative of extreme weather conditions. Afterwhich, i will make a thorough analysis of the data I retrieved.

Data Visualization: Line and bar charts will be used to depict temperature trends, while other visualizations will highlight extreme weather events cases.

OOP Integration: Classes and methods will be used for data retrieval, trend detection, and visualization in some cases.

As required for this project, I have intergrated my chosen APIs from Meteo, NOAA, and WeatherStack. Meteo was used for retrieving historical and NOAA and WeatherStack  were used to fetch current weather data as well as short-term forecasts. Each API contributes unique data which i used for the visualization aspect of the project in order to show the different trends observed.
